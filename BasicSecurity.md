## Passwords

### Invention

The younger the child, the simpler the password ought to be, but loosely use the following system. Then see the "Rotation" section.

1. Pick a sentence at least 7 words such that:
  1. 2 words are random 2 digit numbers, use dice
  2. The words form a silly sentence, try to be as ridiculous as possible and pick long words. E.g. "57 giant potatoes leaked 14 lanterns happily"
  3. Invent a simple system to separate the words, e.g. a full stop, or the last letter is upper case, etc, e.g. "57,gianT,potatoeS,leakeD,14,lanternS,happilY". The more complicated the better, but make sure you can remember it!  **Better start with something simple**
2.
