# Basic Security - Aimed at ALL Ages (but mainly 8 year olds)

## 1 Passwords

### 1.1 Invention

The younger the child, the simpler the password ought to be, but loosely use the following system. Then see section 1.3

1. Pick a sentence at least 7 words such that:
  1. 2 words are random 2 digit numbers, use dice
  2. The words form a silly sentence, try to be as ridiculous as possible and pick long words. E.g. `57 giant potatoes leaked 14 lanterns happily`
  3. Invent a simple system to separate the words, e.g. a full stop, or the last letter is upper case, etc, e.g. `57,gianT,potatoeS,leakeD,14,lanternS,happilY`. The more complicated the better, but make sure you can remember it!  **Better start with something simple**
2. Write it down REALLY clearly in big letters on a sheet of paper with a pen.

### 1.2 Storage



### 1.3 Rotation & Complexity (and when to change)

A password only needs to be as complex as the data it protects.  Since younger children will have data of virtually no value then start with simpler passwords.  Nevertheless _some_ complexity is desirable to train the child from an early age how to secure

## Multi Factor Authentication

## Alternative Authentication Systems (like finger id)

All these new fancy techniques like finger recognition or voice recognition can be convenient for many use cases, but are not as secure as good passwords.  The more complex the technique of authenticating the higher the probability it will contain a flaw or exploit either now, or in the future.  A password guarantees mathematically a certain level of security.  Furthemore it's unclear what the longevity of such techniques are, fingers grow and change, will it always work?

Always use the simplest possible thing that works, because that thing will work most predicably and for the longest amount of time.
